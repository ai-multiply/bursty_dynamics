What is Bursty Dynamics?
************************

Bursty_dynamics is a Python package designed to facilitate the analysis of temporal patterns in longitudinal data. It provides functions to calculate the burstiness parameter (BP) and memory coefficient (MC), detect event trains, and visualize results.

Key Features
------------

- **Burstiness Parameter (BP) and Memory Coefficient (MC) Calculation:**
  Calculate BP and MC to quantify the irregularity and memory effects of event timing within longitudinal data.

- **Event Train Detection:**
  Detect and label event trains based on user-defined criteria such as maximum inter-event time and minimum burst size.

- **Train-Level Analysis:**
  Analyze BP and MC for detected event trains, providing insights into temporal patterns within clusters of events.

- **Visualization Tools:**
  Visualize temporal patterns with scatter plots, histograms, kernel density estimates (KDE), and more, facilitating interpretation of analysis results.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  Designed for ease of use, with clear function parameters and output formats, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.
